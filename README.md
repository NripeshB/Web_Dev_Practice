Web Development Learning Repository:


Welcome to my Web Development Learning Repository. This space is dedicated to documenting my journey as I explore various web development technologies, build small projects, and enhance my skills in both front-end and back-end development.

Throughout this repository, I share the progress I make as I learn and apply new concepts, tools, and techniques. Whether it's experimenting with small projects or improving existing ones, this repository serves as a reflection of my continuous effort to grow as a web developer.

Small Projects:    


I believe in learning by doing, so I work on a variety of small projects to practice and showcase the concepts Iâ€™m learning. These projects span both the front-end and back-end and range from simple static websites to more dynamic applications that involve server-side logic and data handling.

Each project I post here is a step forward in my learning process, and I aim to improve with every new challenge.

Deployment:     


I deploy most of my projects to platforms like Netlify and Heroku to get hands-on experience with hosting and live environments. Instructions for deployment will be included in the individual project directories.
